# Loan-Default-prediction

📊 TVS Loan Default Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on historical loan data from TVS. By analyzing a variety of factors, we build machine learning models to identify patterns that help in predicting the likelihood of default. This solution can assist financial institutions in better managing risk and improving their lending strategies.

Project Highlights
🚀 Machine Learning Models: Built using classification algorithms.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We start by understanding the data with EDA:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers, standardizing data formats.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming categorical data into numerical representations (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
Correlation Analysis: Checking relationships between variables to identify the most influential factors for loan default.
Libraries used for EDA:

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: To create visualizations like heatmaps, box plots, and histograms for understanding the distribution and relationships in the dataset.
Plotly: For interactive and detailed visualizations.

⚙️ Model Building
We utilized multiple machine learning models to predict loan defaults:

Logistic Regression: A simple and interpretable model to start with.
Random Forest: An ensemble model to handle more complex data patterns.
XGBoost: For further boosting the model's accuracy through gradient boosting techniques.
Model Evaluation
Cross-Validation: Used K-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting and ensure model generalizability.
Metrics: Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure robust performance.

🚀 Optimization & Hyperparameter Tuning
To improve model accuracy and efficiency:

GridSearchCV: Performed hyperparameter tuning for optimizing models.
Feature Importance: Identified and ranked the most important features contributing to loan default.

📈 Results
The final model achieved:

Accuracy: 85%+
ROC-AUC Score: 0.90
Precision/Recall: Balanced performance across precision and recall.

✨ Future Improvements
Deep Learning: Implement deep learning models (e.g., neural networks) for more complex patterns.
Model Deployment: Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI to create an interactive web application.
Feature Engineering: Explore additional features that may improve prediction accuracy.
